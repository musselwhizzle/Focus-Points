    they aren't extracted under normal circumstances (must use the -u option)
<li>Read/write Kyocera maker notes properly (although Kyocera information
    remains unknown)
<li>Changed installation tests to tolerate rounding-off errors or format
    differences in floating point numbers
</ul>

<a name='v5.19'><b>May 17, 2005 - Version 5.19</b></a>
<ul>

    GPSAreaInformation
<li>Improved logic for handling command line tag names and exclusions,

<ul>
<li>Fixed problem where the proper tags weren't excluded from being extracted if

<a name='v5.03'><b>Apr. 18, 2005 - Version 5.03</b></a>
<ul>
<li>ExifTool now requires Perl version 5.004 or higher (previously 5.002 was OK)

    the value data of an IFD entry (only affects Casio images)

    <ul>
    <li>Allow any file reference, not only GLOB references, to be used in
        function calls
    </ul>
</ul>

<a name='v5.02'><b>Apr. 16, 2005 - Version 5.02</b></a>
<ul>
<li>Fixed problem rewriting Pentax *istD preview image

<ul>
<li>ALL MAJOR PLANNED WRITING FEATURES NOW IMPLEMENTED!
<li>Finally solved problem of writing large preview images in JPEG files
<li>-AllTagsFromFile now sets PreviewImage to 'dummy' if it exists in the maker
    notes to avoid writing a large preview to the destination file (now you have
    to do this manually afterwards if this is what you want)

<li>Changes to Olympus Lens decoding
</ul>

<a name='v4.95'><b>Apr. 11, 2005 - Version 4.95</b></a>
<ul>
<li>Added ability to delete all meta information, or all information in a group

    missing tags when the -f option is used
<li>Account for different encoding of Canon ExposureTime in 20D and 350D, and
    lower priority of Canon ExposureTime and FNumber so regular EXIF values take
    precedence because it appears these values may be model dependent (I hate it
    when that happens)

    maker notes)
</ul>

<a name='v4.84'><b>Mar. 9, 2005 - Version 4.84</b></a>
<ul>
<li>Interpret Olympus ImageQuality of 6 as RAW
<li>Remove validation of TIFF identifier to allow forward compatibility with
    untested RAW file formats (ORF files in particular seem to fiddle with this
    identifier)
</ul>

<a name='v4.83'><b>Mar. 8, 2005 - Version 4.83</b></a>
<ul>
<li>Extract ThumbnailImage from Canon CRW files written by some cameras
<li>Recognize ORF files from Olympus C5060WZ (and hopefully some others too!)
</ul>

<a name='v4.82'><b>Mar. 7, 2005 - Version 4.82</b></a>

<li>Recognize a number of new and very uncommon EXIF tags
<li>Remove copy number from tag name when using the -S option
<li>Interpret Photoshop XMP:ColorSpace value of 4294967295 as 'Uncalibrated'

<ul>
<li>Added -L option to allow XP characters to be converted to Latin character
    set instead of UTF-8.  (Now XP characters can be displayed properly in
    terminal windows which use either the UTF-8 or WinLatin1 character set.)
<li>Make JpgFromRaw image writable in Nikon NEF files

<ul>
<li>Recognize JPEG 2000 XMP UUID information
<li>Extract Meta information from JPEG APP3
<li>Yet more playing with XP characters (this has been a learning process for
    me). Now special characters show up properly in my OSX terminal window, and
    the reverse translation works so now they get written properly as well (for
    Perl 5.6.1 or greater anyway... Earlier versions don't have the required
    UTF-8 support to handle these special characters)
<li>Improvements to TagNames documentation (including changing format names to

<ul>
<li>Convert XPTitle, XPComment, XPKeywords etc from XP character codes and add
    write support for these tags
<li>Decode JPEG 2000 Resolution, Label and URL information
<li>Another try at patching 3 digit exponent situation which causes failed tests
    on MSWin32-x86
<li>Removed .J2K from recognized extensions (since apparently this is a raw JP2
    codestream, and doesn't contain any metadata that ExifTool can extract)
</ul>

<a name='v4.61'><b>Feb. 14, 2005 - Version 4.61</b></a>

</ul>

<a name='v4.44'><b>Jan. 30, 2005 - Version 4.44</b></a>
<ul>
<li>Sort entries in synthesized Canon MakerNotes directory

</ul>

<a name='v4.40'><b>Jan. 26, 2005 - Version 4.40</b></a>
<ul>
<li>Added ability to write Canon RAW (CRW) files.  With this format you aren't
    allowed to add or delete any new tags (just as with the MakerNotes), except
    for JpgFromRaw, which I like to be able to delete to save disk space
<li>Added validation of JpgFromRaw images
<li>Relax filtering on non-ASCII characters by exiftool script to allow
    high-ASCII characters to be printed
<li>Changed the tense of Orientation values to try to make the meaning more
    clear.  This tag can be a bit confusing. It gives the rotation that must be
    applied to the image to view it properly (hence the rotation of the camera
    when the picture was taken).
<li>Patched problem which was causing failed tests on some platforms (floating
    point format has 3 digits in exponent on Perl 5.8.5 MSWin32-x86, grrrr...)
<li>API Changes:

</ul>

<a name='v4.32'><b>Jan. 19, 2005 - Version 4.32</b></a>
<ul>
<li>Now rewrites Casio EX-Z3 maker notes properly (well, not actually
    'properly', but the way they were written in the first place, which is
    wrong)
<li>Added warning when writing information if original IFD entries were not in
    the proper sequence, which is a violation of EXIF specs.  (And surprise,
    you'll never guess who does this too...  Yup, the EX-Z3.)
<li>Fixed parsing problem with GPSProcessingMethod and GPSAreaInformation
<li>No longer truncates 'undef' values at first null character
<li>Changed all DataDump tags to binary data types
<li>Changed some warning messages

    since version 4.10)
<li>Added some more writer tests
</ul>

<a name='v4.31'><b>Jan. 18, 2005 - Version 4.31</b></a>

</ul>

<a name='v4.30'><b>Jan. 18, 2005 - Version 4.30</b></a>
<ul>
<li>Now copies over preview images in EXIF data (large, external previews still
    not copied)
<li>Account for funny offsets in Casio EX-Z3 maker notes while extracting data
    (but haven't figured out how to handle them when writing)
<li>Fixed bug introduced in 4.20 that broke extraction of Canon PreviewImage
</ul>

    directory running outside the maker notes data. If they do, a warning is
